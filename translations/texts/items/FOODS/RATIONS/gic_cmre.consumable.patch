You'd be wrong: It's just a solid mass of brown, edible food-loaf. At least it comes with a water bottle to wash it down, and some corn to help it pass.\n Type: Universal",
    "value": "配发给多数联合系部队的现代化口粮包。可能你会认为盒子打开后能拿出更多小份的独立食物包装。那你就错了：这里只有一团棕色的食用物 -- 餐包条。好在它至少配了一瓶水来把它从嗓子里冲下去，还有罐玉米粒来帮它润滑一下。\n类型：通用"
