    "raw": "A confection usually flavored and colored black with the extract of liquorice plant roots. Surprisingly filling but typically bitter, waxy, and utterly unenjoyable. As a potable pellet of personal punishment, you can sustain yourself with some of these purely because you're addicted to self-loathing. Note that red-liquorice is completely different in that it doesn't use liquorice at all, and is thus infinitely better.\n^green;Type: Sugar^reset;",
    "value": "通常用甘草类植物的根部提取物调味并被其染成黑色的“甜食”。令人惊讶的不是它增加的饱腹度，而是它那饱满而典型的苦涩、嚼蜡感和完全让人无福消受的风味。作为一粒粒自含苦果般的个人惩罚，你可以拿出其中的一些来支撑自己，纯粹是因为你正沉迷于自我厌恶。请注意，红色甘草糖的味道完全不同，因为它里面就根本没加甘草，所以吃起来真是棒极了。\n^green;类型：糖类^reset;"
