    "raw": "A small box of bread-based crackers. Crumbly and bland as hell. The salt content leaves something to be desired. And trying to use these as individual crackers seems futile as they'd just fall apart in your grasp. Best to just grind it into a powder and wash it down quickly with some kind of drink before you gag on what feels like edible sand. The profound taste of disappointment is probably why someone left these behind in the first place. Maybe you should too...\nType: Universal",
    "value": "一小盒面包边做的饼干。碎脆无奇。咸口还有点不够。好像永远也没什么办法能让它们在盒子里保持完好，因为它们稍微拿在手捏一下就碎了。在你被可食用沙砾呛住嗓子然后咳嗽得塞满鼻腔之后，最好是把它碾成粉末，然后用什么喝的就水咽了。失望的深刻滋味可能就是有人把它抛在这里的原因所在。也许你也该这么做……\n类型：通用"
