    "raw": "\nAs for the X'i themselves...how they came to be is, strictly speaking, impossible. They remain the only example of life that is silicon-based even being possible! The radioactive bulbs within them are the sentient part of the being, a consciousness contained within. The plant-like outer body is their self, and it hardens over time until calcifying into mineral-hard 'flesh'. Eventually, generally after death, it becomes graphite. Their actual bodies sprout feather-like hair that is both supple and soft. It appears to be highly resistant to radiation (effectively nullifying it).\nIt is likely the case, then, that without these feathers the X'i would be virtually unable to socialize with the galactic community. Their very presence would make them a hazard to the health of every current intelligent civilization we know about. They pose next to no threat, thankfully, and are valuable members of any team they assist.\n\nWhile they have issues communicating they are outgoing, personable and always ready to help others. Frankly, it's rare to find a group so collectively pleasant to be around. There's a reason for this, however...See, X'i have exceptionally open dietary needs. They can effectively eat whatever they want to sate their near-constant hunger. You will almost never meet a X'i who is not frequently snacking! Without food their cores begin to die down, and this leads to lethargy, weakness and (as is the case with every other race) eventually death. A side-effect of their constant eating is that a good many food types they enjoy (dirt, especially) possess narcotic-like effects on their moods not unlike heavy dopamines. With their pleasure-centers so easily stimulated, it is easy to see why they are pleasant companions.\nUltimately, the X'i are much closer to an organic-inorganic hybrid...a perfect mix of Silicon and Carbon-based life. A homonculus such as this is surely not a purely natural occurrence. I fail to see how in any natural circumstance this specific coincidence of genetics could occur.\n\nShould anyone find a way to explain it, I'm all ears. Until then, I will have no choice but to assume they are the product of third-party intervention. I believe it most likely that this was during their early development before true sentience had been achieved. As to who made them...who can say? The mysteries of the cosmos are vast and terrifying.",
    "value": "\n至于艾肯本身......严格来说，关于它们是如何形成的，简直是万中无一。他们甚至可能是是唯一一种以硅为基础的生命的例子！他们体内的放射性灯球茎是生命有意识部分，意识就存于其中。像植物一样的外体则是它们的自我，随着时间的推移，它会变硬，直到钙化成矿物般坚硬的“肉体”。最终，一般在其死后，躯体会变成石墨。他们的实际身体长出羽毛状的毛发，既柔韧又柔软。这些毛发似乎对辐射有很强的抵抗力（有效地使其失效）。\n那么，很可能的情况是，如果没有这些羽毛，艾肯人将几乎无法与宇宙社会交流。他们的存在会使他们对我们所知的每个当前智能文明的健康造成危害。值得庆幸的是，他们几乎不构成威胁，而且他们是其所协助的任何团队的宝贵成员。\n\n虽然他们在沟通上有问题，但他们性格外向，有个性，总是愿意帮助别人。坦率地说，很少能找到一个如此集体愉快的群体。然而，这是有原因的......看，艾肯的饮食需求特别开放。他们可以有效地吃任何他们想吃的东西来满足他们近乎持续的饥饿感。你几乎不会遇到一个不抱着小石子啃的艾肯! 没有食物，他们的核心就会开始消亡，这导致他们昏昏欲睡，身体虚弱，（就像所有其他种族一样）最终死亡。他们不断进食的一个副作用是，他们喜欢的许多食物类型（尤其是泥土）对他们的情绪具有类似麻醉剂的作用，与重度多巴胺无异。由于他们的快乐中心如此容易受到刺激，很容易理解为什么他们是愉快的伙伴。\n最终，艾肯人更接近于有机和无机混合体...硅和碳基生命的完美结合。像这样的混血肯定不是纯自然发生的。我看不出在任何自然情况下，这种特定的遗传学巧合会如何发生。\n\n如果有人找到解释的方法，我洗耳恭听。在那之前，我没什么假定，只能假设它们是第三方干预的产物。我认为这很有可能是在他们的早期发展过程中，还未产生真正的意识。至于谁制造了它们...谁能说得清呢？宇宙间的辛秘水很深。"
