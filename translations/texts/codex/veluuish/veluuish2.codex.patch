    "raw": "The Vat'iish are a prideful faction and, while they are intelligent, they scorn the Kir'vat and their 'cowardly' ways, choosing instead to forge the path of the warrior. They use the galaxy as their own personal trophy cabinet, sieging inhabited worlds and taking over the settlements that may be stationed there, just to show that they can. They are cunning, deceitful, and will never do anything for anyone without a good incentive to do so.",
    "value": "瓦特力士是一个骄傲的派系，虽然他们很聪明，但他们蔑视基尔瓦特派和他们的懦弱方式，而选择开拓战士的道路。他们把星系当作自己的战利品陈列柜，搜寻有人居住的世界，接管那些可能驻扎在那里的定居点，只是为了证明他们可以。他们狡猾、欺骗，如果没有好的动机，他们绝不会为任何人做任何事。"
