All I know is that I'm constantly hungry and it's always raining. I normally don't mind the rain, but my drafty little hut is constantly leaking and I really don't like having to sleep on a wet bed every night. It's the worst. Well, at least the food is plentiful on this little planet, even if I do have to go out and hunt for it. Oh what I wouldn't do for some catnip right now...",
