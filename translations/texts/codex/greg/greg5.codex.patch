However, subject appears to have forgotten how to be a rat and is busy screeching at other rats in the room. Prion count is absurdly high. We won't merge him with the population this time as I have no desire to clean rat viscera off of every surface in the lab again.",

I checked the tapes from the night: no one entered or tampered with the experiments.",

He becomes increasingly agitated trying to communicate with us. He clearly *thinks* he is talking fine. Yet all that comes out is 'Greg'. I've recommended he stay contained due to how the rats reacted to C7.",
    "value": "过了2个星期格雷格终于从他的房间里走出来了。他表现的有点...异常,他一直不停地重复他的名字，一遍又一遍的重复。没有缘由。他变得越来越激动并且想试着与我们交流。他显然'认为'他说的很好，但所有从他嘴里说出来的话只有'格雷格'，我建议他最好待在他的房间里，这让我很难不联想到C7是怎样影响其他老鼠的事。"
