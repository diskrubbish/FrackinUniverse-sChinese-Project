    "raw": "The plague has torn through our people like wheat to a scythe, and it's been particularly difficult to reach the point we finally did today. Greg found a cure! Or, rather, a potential one. We're going to try it on the rat-things today and begin observation. It should be noted that initial trials on genes in the lab were successful, though the method of transmission is unclear.",

I do wonder how Greg solved the issue with the prion being so aggressive. He swears he didn't use the strange fluid we found on that moon orbiting Coronis IV. I am uncertain that I believe this, as Greg is not exactly the sort to accept delays on his results.",
    "value": "实验鼠C7的测试结果看起来很好，起泡病变的组织开始迅速衰退。终于，我们的研究有了成果！我真想知道格雷格是如何如此迅速的解决朊病毒高侵略性的问题的。他向我们发誓说他没有使用我们在在月球轨道的Coronis-IV星球所发现的奇怪液体。我对这种解释深表怀疑，而且格雷戈并不是那种愿意接受他的研究成果因故被延误的人。"
