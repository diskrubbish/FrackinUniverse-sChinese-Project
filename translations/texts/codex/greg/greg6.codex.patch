    "raw": "While it took weeks, we have isolated the problem. Some sort of rapidly mutating particle, so small as to be undetectable even in the electron microscope, has tainted the main sample. The source of this particle remains largely unknown, though my theory that Greg mixed some of that fluid into his batch seems the most likely cause.",
    "value": "虽然花了几个星期，我们还是隔离了这个问题。某种快速变异的粒子，小到以至于即使在电子显微镜下也无法探测到，已经污染了主要样本。这种粒子的来源很大程度上仍是未知的，尽管我的理论认为，格雷格混合了一些液体到他的批次中似乎是最有可能的原因。"
