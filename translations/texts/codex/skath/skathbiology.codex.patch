To combat this, Skath have created environmental still-suits to recycle their moisture and keep themselves comfortable.",

At this point, both are responsible for the teaching of young.",

This makes the Skath the fastest populating race in the known galaxy next to the Thelusians (which is of great concern to the Protectorate due to the Affordance Treaties of 2331).",
    "value": "社交技能和战斗技能是绘世者一族最强大和最基本的生存技能。幼年绘世者大约只需要经过两年时间即可成年。这使得他们的繁殖速度在宇宙中仅次于蚁族（依据2331号共和条约，宇宙联合政体对此非常关注）。"
