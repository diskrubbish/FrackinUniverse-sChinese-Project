It is the only such form of government known in the cosmos (for how can only four dictate the course of an entire species?) but has maintained power over the Skath Imperium for at least two to three hundred years.",
    "value": "绘世者一族的政体被称为“古老者议会”，就像它的名字一样，四位他们种族的古老者统治着整个族群。这是宇宙中已知的唯一一种这样形式的政府（为什么四个人就可以决定整个族群的命运？），但他却维持了绘世者帝国至少两百到三百年的秩序。"

Personally, I find it hard to believe that an entire species agreed that absolute power over all should rest on the shoulders of their Elders. The logistics of that are frightening, to say the least. The reality is worse.",
    "value": "据说第一届议会是由人民投票选出的，但关于那个时代的所有文件早已失传。就我个人而言，我很难相信整个族群都会同意凌驾于一切之上的权利应该被赋予古老者。这其中的逻辑令人害怕，至少可以说，现实比我们想象的更糟。"
