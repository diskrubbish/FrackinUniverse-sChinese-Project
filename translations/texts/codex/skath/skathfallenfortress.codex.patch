I suggest we find a way to encourage a war between these two species in order to reduce their surplus populations, lest we all suffer the consequences of unchecked growth. We will otherwise choke on their numbers.",

We'd face annihilation at best...slavery at the worst. There is no winning in the face of such numbers.",
