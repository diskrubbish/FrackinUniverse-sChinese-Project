At first I was disoriented, and thought I was back with the Florans. But no. It seems I'd accidentally presented myself for sacrifice. So silly!",

There were a few casualties along the way, of course - some sacred urns, a statue or two, an Avian monk - but I escaped intact, and carried on my way.",
