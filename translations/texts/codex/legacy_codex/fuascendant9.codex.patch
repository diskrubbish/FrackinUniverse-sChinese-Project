    "value": "已经完成了。大喙从此出局。没人怀疑什么。但我还是很担惊受怕。你看，那位氦离子刺客在完成暗杀后拜访了我。这简直闻所未闻。因为这些刺客几乎从不向客户展示自己。不过这次，我在夜晚醒来，感觉到一只手搭在我的肩膀上。"

    "value": " 这位刺客不同于我的想象。他说话温和，冷静。他的名字叫希什，他说他不仅认识我母亲。她死的时候他也一直在她身旁。我问他这件事是否意味着我认为其中有蹊跷。他摇了摇头，我想我能从他的眼中看出悲伤。"

'Why risk your life to achieve godhood when you can become a god of your own making?' he asked. I thought about the Celestial Tower, about the fall, about the numerous Avians who did not fly.",
    "value": "他问起了飞升。 我向他解释了这一切，关于我成为太阳之子的历程。这为氦离子刺客笑了，并指责我的妄尊自大。 “当你能成为自己制造的神灵之时，你还有什么理由去冒着生命危险来得到神性呢？” 他问。 我开始思索，思索关于水晶塔，关于坠落，和那些没有飞起来的无数翼族人。"
