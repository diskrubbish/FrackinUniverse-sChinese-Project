    "raw": "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer\nLet it never be said that I do not attempt to integrate with whichever hosts I find myself indebted to. I have noticed that when addressing me, the Glitch use prefix words. Examples: 'Dismissive', 'Annoyed', 'Sarcastic' and 'Frustrated'. Feeling as if this is a custom I should celebrate, I have begun to partake in such linguistic frippery myself.",

    "raw": "'Delight. It is nice to see you.' I said, but the Glitch just looked at me strangely, and then said something to his friend. I noticed something here, too. When the Glitch address each other, they do not use these prefix words. Perhaps something in their programming means they can read each others' tones without explanation.",
    "value": "“高兴。很高兴见到你。”我说，但电子人们只是奇怪地看着我，然后对他的朋友说了些什么。我也注意到了。当电子人之间互相称呼时，他们不使用这些前缀词。也许他们程序中的某些东西意味着他们可以不加解释地读出对方的声调。"
