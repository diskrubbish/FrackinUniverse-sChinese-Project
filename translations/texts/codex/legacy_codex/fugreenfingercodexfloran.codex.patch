    "raw": "Due to a reliance on natural water sources thanks to the Floran's [REDACTED] roots, it transpires that Floran biology leaves individuals susceptible to extreme heat. All Florans know that fire equals danger, but many are unaware of the toll that dry, humid conditions can take on the body.",
    "value": "多亏依赖天然水源，也多亏了叶族人[已编辑]的根，叶族人的生理结构使其个体容易受到极端高温的影响。所有叶族人都知道火等于危险，但许多人却不知道干燥、潮湿的环境也会对身体造成伤害。"

    "raw": "Prolonged exposure to desert climate can leave Florans in a mummified, barely living state, before they eventually succumb to the elements, crumbling to dust. As the species expands its territory, it has been important to find ways in which the Florans can adapt their biology in order to survive inhospitable climes.",
    "value": "长期暴露在沙漠气候中会使叶族人人变成木乃伊状，几乎丧失生命，直到他们最终屈服于大自然，化为尘土。随着物种的扩张，找到适应生理结构的方法来适应不适宜生存的气候变得非常重要。"
