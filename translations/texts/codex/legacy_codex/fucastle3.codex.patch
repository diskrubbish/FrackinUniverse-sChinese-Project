    "raw": "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer\nThe Glitch may not be the warmest of people on the outside, but their hospitality is indisputable. They found me scaling the castle wall, simply wanting to have a look through a tower window, and politely invited me inside. Now, of course it sounded like a trap, so there was a bit of a scuffle at first, but it turned out they were genuine.",
    "value": "由鲛人探险家平木·圣咏所著\n电子人可能不是表现得最热情的人，但他们的好客是不容置疑的。他们发现我爬上城堡的墙，只是想从塔楼的窗户里看看，就礼貌地邀请我进去。现在，当然，这听起来像是一场陷阱，所以起初有一场混战，但事实证明他们是真诚的。"
