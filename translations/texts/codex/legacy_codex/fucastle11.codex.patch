    "raw": "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer\nDue to my frequent attempts at cultural sensitivity, I decided to try and integrate myself with my hosts even more. While exploring the castle, I found a number of decorative suits of armour that appear to depict warrior Glitch. Naturally, to make my companions comfortable, I put a set on.",

    "raw": "The armour was hard to walk in, so I lost my balance a few times. I came tumbling down the stairs and into the main hall, and all Glitch eyes were on me. Rather than the warm greeting I deserved, however, they began to chatter and yell. I heard the words 'Anger' and 'Disgust' a number of times. And then they began to chase me.",
