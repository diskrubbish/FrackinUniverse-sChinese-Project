    "raw": "One day I was fortunate enough to meet with a member of the Avian Clipped Council, a group of flightless Avians who serve their ruler, Kluex. We shared talk, and stories, and eventually a bottle of particularly potent meatjuice. This loosened the Avian's tongue even more, and I was able to ask her about the Grounded, and how her people deal with those who defy their god.",
