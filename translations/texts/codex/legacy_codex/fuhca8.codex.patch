    "raw": "I boarded another airship village today, when it had stopped to dock. Climbed my way up the anchor and squirreled myself into a cabin before anyone could complain. Everything was going well; the captain, a jolly fellow called Wrenolds, allowed me to teach him how to play Lilyflip. We were half way through a game when it happened. I was winning.",

He muttered something about power crystals, and then I heard him mention my dear friend Greenfinger, who they were apparently going to see. What luck! I informed him he could drop me off there.",
