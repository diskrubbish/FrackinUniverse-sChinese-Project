Immediately I felt at peace, like a calm had descended over me. I walked the stone hallways, gazing up at the statues of that giant bird, occasionally greeting priests and worshippers alike. They seemed pleased to see me.",

Priests milled about, but they did not seem to mind when I lay down. In fact, they began to cheep and cheer. One of them handed me a delicious, sweet-tasting drink. Soon, I drifted off to sleep.",
    "value": "我爬上庙宇，渐渐感到疲惫，在连续几天的冒险和逃亡之后，我疲惫的双腿几乎要断掉了。在山顶，我发现了一张石床。牧师们在附近转来转去，但是当我躺下的时候，他们似乎并不介意。事实上，他们开始欢呼雀跃。其中一个人递给我一杯美味甜美的饮料。很快，我就睡着了。"
