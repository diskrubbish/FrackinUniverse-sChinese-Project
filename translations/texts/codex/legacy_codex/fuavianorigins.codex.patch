    "raw": "For centuries, the Avians soared through the skies, borne on wings of feather and flesh. They were a proud, peaceful species, respectful of their traditions and gods. So respectful, in fact, that when their gods - the Sunborn - spoke to them, they listened. They listened and obeyed as one god, Kluex, the last of the Sunborn, commanded their elders to clip the wings of the lower-caste Avians.",
    "value": "几个世纪以来，翼族人凭借羽毛和血肉的翅膀在天空中飞翔。他们是一个骄傲而和平的物种，尊重他们的传统和神。事实上，当他们的神——太阳神——对他们说话的时候，他们聆听着。他们听从并服从一个神，克鲁克斯，最后的太阳神，它命令翼族人的祖先折断低种姓翼族人的翅膀。"

    "raw": "They obeyed even as the Flightless became ostracised, oppressed, living only to serve Kluex. They obeyed as their elders erected tall towers, from which the Ascendants - the chosen Flightless - were to leap. They obeyed as one by one, the Ascendants hit the ground, never to fly again. Kluex, they were told, was pleased. ",
    "value": "他们服从了，纵使这些不会飞的翼族人被放逐，被压迫，只为克鲁克斯服务。他们服从于祖先们竖起的高塔，飞升者——被选中的不会飞的人——从上面跳下去。他们一个接一个地服从命令，飞升者们坠落地面，再也没有飞起来。他们被告知，克鲁克斯很高兴。"
