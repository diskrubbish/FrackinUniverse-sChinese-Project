    "raw": "Deep in the bowels of this place, I met a most curious Avian, who has rejected the teachings of her species and defied her gods. We spoke of freedom, and free will, and choice, and the soul. She gave me much to ponder over. Then one of my Greenguard peers threw a bucket of swill in her face. Perhaps there is meaning in this. I shall muse on it as I sleep tonight.",
    "value": "在这个地方的深处，我遇到了一个最好奇的翼族人，她拒绝接受她的种族的教导，违抗她的神。我们谈到了自由、自由意志、选择和灵魂。她给了我许多思考的机会。然后我的一个绿林守卫同事朝她脸上泼了一桶泔水。也许这是有意义的。今晚睡觉的时候，我将沉思这件事。"
