    "raw": "It soon became clear that injecting Drysap into living Florans prompted exceptional results. The sap quickly reproduces within Floran veins, replacing their own with a stronger, hardier substance that leaves the Floran body requiring almost no water. To an extent, this is a miracle serum.",
    "value": "很快我们就明白了，将干树汁注射到活着的叶族人体内可以产生非同寻常的效果。树液在叶族人的叶脉中迅速繁殖，用一种更强壮、更坚韧的物质取代自己，这种物质离开叶族人的身体之后几乎不需要水分。在某种程度上，这是一种神奇的血清。"
