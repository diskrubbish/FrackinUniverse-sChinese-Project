    "raw": "The Avians have perpetrated a wonderful deception. The rumour that the corpses of their gods - their gods! - rest in their tombs has spread throughout the universe. Such rumours attract looters, and said looters make for a handy, never-ending source of live sacrifices, to use in their silly rituals. It is genius, even by my standards.",
