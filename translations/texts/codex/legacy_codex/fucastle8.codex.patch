    "raw": "All the Glitch watched as their king fell backwards, his Glitch disguise falling away, revealing a small, black and white bird-like creature. The Glitch had been duped! All this time, their tyrannical, unusual king had been a space pirate in disguise. It made perfect sense. Realising the game was up, and badly injured, the evil space pirate made his escape, never to be seen again.",
    "value": "所有的电子人都注视着他们的国王向后倒下，他的电子人伪装脱落，露出一只黑白相间的鸟状生物。电子人们被骗了！一直以来，他们的暴君，不寻常的国王一直是一个伪装的太空海盗。这完全说得通。意识到游戏结束，受了重伤，邪恶的太空海盗逃走了，再也没有露面。"

She was made an honorary hero of the Glitch people, but then immediately exiled because killing kings is bad, even if they were penguins in disguise. From that day forth, the Glitch vowed never to allow another monarch to take control, even if they asked really nicely.",
    "value": "这个兵痞子原来只是位一时兴起的叶族人，她只是觉得无聊，于是决定去疯狂地打猎。她被授予电子人族荣誉英雄的称号，但随后又被立即放逐，因为杀死国王是不好的行为，即使国王是企鹅装的。从那天起，电子人发誓再也不允许另一个君主掌权，即使他们非常被恳切地请求。"
