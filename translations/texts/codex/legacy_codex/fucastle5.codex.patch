    "raw": "The new Glitch king called himself Dreadwing, and ruled with an iron fist. His subjects were expected to work day and night, which at first was not a problem for the Glitch since they rarely feel the need to rest. Soon, however, it became clear that the wear and tear on Glitch parts was an issue, and Dreadwing demanded the construction of more Glitch to boost his ranks.",

For as long as they could, they put off this task, until one day Dreadwing descended into a fit of such ferocious anger that the Glitch knew they had to do something.",
