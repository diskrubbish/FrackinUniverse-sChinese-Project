    "raw": "Day 5 - Yuck. While trying to get away from the sea of transparent metal, I found myself in another cave system, the floor of which oddly did not absorb my light like the rock had before. I probably should have been more careful, but one step on this stuff, and I found myself sliding down a steep incline, and when I landed, I bounced around the room several times and wound up face-first in some of the most disgusting tar-like substance I've ever seen! I managed to somehow crawl out of the junk and back up onto more rock.",
