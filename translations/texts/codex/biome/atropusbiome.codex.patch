    "raw": "Little is known of what have been dubbed 'Atropus' worlds. The reference to atrophy is apt, for the innate strangeness of these celestial bodies cause murmurs of fear in every known species inhabiting the galaxy. Many theorize these fleshy worlds are sapient. Preposterous, but people will always be superstitious. Still, one must give credit where it is due: These places are unsettling.",
    "value": "人们对所谓的“肉源”世界知之甚少。根据atrophy(萎缩)来命名它十分恰当，因为这些天体内在的古怪在银河系的所有已知物种中都引起了恐惧的低语。许多理论认为这些肉质的世界是具有智慧的。这很荒谬，但人们总是迷信于此。尽管如此，有一件事是肯定的：这些地方令人十分不安。"

    "raw": "The stench can only be tolerated for so long. Eventually the rankness permeates even the most adequate protections. At that point it becomes almost impossible to keep a mask on. Involuntarily, you will eventually try to pry it off, despite knowing the air makes you crazy. The team has dubbed it 'the meat fever' and it is liable to be the death of us if care is not taken.",
    "value": "你只能忍受这种恶臭一段时间。最后，即使是最充分的保护也会被渗透。到那时，要戴上面具几乎是不可能的。你会不由自主地撬开它，尽管你知道这里的大气会让你发疯。该研究小组将其命名为“血肉狂热”，如果不加以治疗，它可能会导致我们的死亡。"
