    "raw": "Day 6 - \nI found it! Too bad I am so deep in, I'm not sure I could possibly get back out. I found the ore... you can't miss it. It glows with this gentle sky-blue color, lighting entire cave systems up. For some weird reason, the rocks that ate my flashlight beams, don't eat this type of light. I wish I could get a sample of this to a lab... but sadly I don't think I'm going to make it. If anybody finds this... please... take this book back to Earth and give it to my family...\n - M. Hodgins",
    "value": "第六天 - \n我找到它了！十分糟糕的是我在洞穴里陷得太深了，我不确定我能不能安全脱身。 我找到了那种矿石...你不能错过它。 它发出的温柔的天蓝色光线，照亮了整个洞穴系统。 出于一些奇怪的原因，吞噬手电筒光束的那些岩石不吞噬这种光。我希望我能把这个样本送到实验室....但遗憾的是我认为我已经做不到了。 如果有人发现这些...请...把这本书带回地球并交给我的家人... \n - M. 霍金斯"
