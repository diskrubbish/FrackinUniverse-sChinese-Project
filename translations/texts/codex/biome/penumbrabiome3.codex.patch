    "raw": "Day 3 - \nI found a small natural cave system, and decided to take a rest. The rock found on these planets is unusually hard, and it has this weird property that absorbs light. Even shining my flashlight directly at this rock, I can't see very much of anything around me as the rock appears to eat the light coming out of my flashlight. I lit a campfire in here, after I felt a breeze slipping through the cracks, hopefully I don't choke myself with the smoke. I can see more caves below, I'll explore those in a minute.",
