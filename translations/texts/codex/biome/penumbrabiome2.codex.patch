    "raw": "Day 2 - \nBeamed down on this strange planet to find myself surrounded by some of the weirdest foilage -- tree-like plant structures that have big round glowing skyblue bulbs on them, small little flowers that glow with light. I also keep hearing distant sounds, rustling of weeds, but I can't see more than a few feet in front of me, even with a flashlight. I think I'm going to start digging down into the ground, maybe board the exit off behind me. I don't want to get pulled into the jungle by some nasty beast or something.",
    "value": "第二天 - \n在这个奇怪的星球上打亮手电，我发现自己周围环绕着一些十分怪诞的树叶——树状植物结构，上面有大圆形的发光的天蓝色灯泡，小小的花朵随着光线照射生长。 我也一直听到远处传来声音，和杂草的沙沙声，但是我即使是用手电，我的能见度也不到几英尺。 我想我会开始深挖地面，也许出口就在后方。 我可不想被一些令人讨厌的野兽或其他的东西拽进丛林。"
