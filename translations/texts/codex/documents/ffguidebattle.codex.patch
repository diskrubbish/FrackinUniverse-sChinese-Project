    "raw": "\n^orange;Monster Resistances^reset;\n------------------------\nSome monsters resist, or are completely immune to, certain types of damage.\n\nTo combat these threats you are going to need weapons of ^green;different elemental types^reset; at any given moment. Try to use ^green;at least 2 to 3^reset; of the more than 8 available types so you are ready for any challenge.\n\n\n^blue;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n\n\n^orange;Weapons and Combat^reset;\n----------------------\nRanged and Melee weapons behave a little differently in FrackinUniverse. The most important changes are listed in this codex.\n\n\n^orange;Crit Chance and Crit Damage^reset;\n---------------------------\nWeapon item tooltips have new icons. The two on the left represent Critical Chance bonus and Critical Damage bonus.\n\n\n^orange;Ammo and Reload Speed^reset;\n---------------------------\nAmmo and Reload speed are represented by the right-side icons.\n\nItems with a '--' representing a value in any of the above stats means it does not apply to them. This is the case with modded weapons, or energy-only (non-ammo) guns, primarily.\n\n\n^orange;Mastery^reset;\n---------------\n\nOccasionally, you'll see Mastery traits applied to equippable gear, or in Racial Bonuses. These imply that you have greater capability in a particular weapon type. Generally speaking, ^yellow;Masteries^reset; simply ^cyan;improve already existing weapon benefits^reset; including Tech bonuses. In an upcoming topic below, you'll see various weapons listed along with the various capabilities each carries with it. These listed benefits will all be improved through ^yellow;Mastery^reset;.\n\nAn example: When wielded individually a Rapier will provide an increase to Crit Chance when timing strikes carefully (to a max of 5). The amount of the bonus applied is higher by the amount listed in your ^yellow;Mastery^reset; stat. At 100% this would mean a maximum Crit Chance bonus of +10.\n\nThe amount of benefit gained can vary from weapon to weapon. In some cases you will get a modifier based directly on your ^yellow;Mastery^reset; trait, while others will reduce that value by half, quarter, eigth or other such fractions.\n\n\n\n^blue;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n\n\n^green;Ranged^reset;\n----------------------------------\n\n^orange;Ammo-Based Weapons^reset;\n------------------\nSome weapons now use ammunition. Don't worry, you won't need to carry resources around with you to refill them. These weapons simply use much, much less energy in exchange for the mobility boost provided by having extra energy! Note that their alt fires will always require energy, regardless of their primary fire.\n\nYou can reload these weapons manually by holding the SHIFT key and clicking the mouse button. Emptying the magazine through shooting will also automatically engage the reload.\n\n^orange;Ammo Mastery^reset;\n------------------\nThis Mastery is quite straightforward: your rating in Ammo Mastery directly correlates to the % reduced from your Reload Time as well as the $ of ammo gained per magazine.\n\n^orange;Pistol^reset;\n------------------\nWith mastery applied, Pistols gain increased Damage, reduced reload time and a higher critical strike chance.\n\n^orange;Machine Pistol^reset;\n------------------\nWith mastery applied, Machine Pistols gain increased Damage, reduced reload time and a higher critical strike chance.\n\n^orange;Arm Cannon^reset;\n------------------\nWith mastery applied, Arm Cannons provide varied benefits based on how they are wielded. Power, Crit Chance, Crit Damage and Protection are all impacted. When using just arm cannons (dual or single) you get less protection benefits but a much higher critical chance. With an armcannon and shield you gain a much better protection bonus in exchange for reduced power.\n\n^orange;Assault Rifle^reset;\n------------------\nAssault rifles benefit from mastery by increasing overall damage output while increasing magazine size and critical damage.\n\n^orange;Sniper Rifle^reset;\n------------------\nWith a mastery in Sniper rifles you gain magazine size and critical chance. This stacks with the usual crit benefits of sniper rifles and allows for a very high crit chance with charge-ups!\n\n^orange;Grenade Launcher^reset;\n----------------------\nWhen wielding grenade launchers with mastery expect to gain increased damage and magazine size while also benefiting from reduced reload time.\n\n^orange;Rocket Launcher^reset;\n----------------------\nObliterating the enemy is easy with mastery in rockets! You'll do a lot more damage, reload faster and have increased magazine size.\n\n^orange;Shotgun^reset;\n----------------------\nThese dangerous weapons, when mastered, profice exceptional crit chance and power along with increased magazine size and reduced reload time.\n\n^orange;Magnorb^reset;\n----------------------\nThese unusual weapons provide increased damage, crit chance, crit damage and energy to masters that wield them.\n\n^orange;Bow^reset;\n----------------------\nBows have a large number of benefits masters can take advantage of. Crit damage and crit chance increase, along with damage. In addition, they can fire bows faster and shoot arrows farther while consuming less energy!\n\n^orange;Whip^reset;\n----------------------\nWhip users get a sizeable increase in crit chance and crit damage while also increasing damage output with this mastered weapon.\n\n\n^blue;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^green;Melee^reset;\n\n^orange;Combos^reset;\n---------------\nEach strike of a combo, whether or not it hits a target, consumes 1% of your energy. Be warned, tactics involving stun-locking enemies are no longer as viable.\n\nMany weapons with combos provide additional bonuses when striking with these combos.\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Shield Bash^reset;\n---------------\nBlocking with shields on enemies has a chance to Shield Bash. Certain gear can increase the Shield Bash chances.\n\nShield Bash can damage foes, and send them reeling backwards. When Perfect Blocking, there is a 50% chance to Stun foes that are successfully bashed. When not perfect blocking, be wary: There is a chance -you- will get stunned on a badly timed block.\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Hammer^reset;\n---------------\nThe longer you hold the charge of this melee weapon type, the higher your Critical and Stun chance get (to a maximum of ^green;100^reset;%).\n\nA hammer charged above ^green;75^reset;% will inflict a massive bonus eruption capable of stunning and tossing foes around.\n\nOver-Charging the hammer past ^green;100^reset;% will automatically cancel the bonus.\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Great Axe^reset;\n---------------\nThe longer you hold the charge of this melee weapon type, the higher your Critical Chance and Critical Damage get (to a maximum of ^green;100^reset;%).\n\nA greataxe charged above ^green;75^reset;% will inflict a massive bonus eruption capable of bleeding and tossing foes around.\n\nOver-Charging the greataxe past ^green;100^reset;% will automatically cancel the bonus.\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Axe^reset;\n---------------\nEach consecutive kill made with an axe increases your maximum damage by +^green;1^reset;%, to a maximum of ^green;50^reset;%.\n\nIf your health is reduced below ^red;20^reset;%, this bonus is cancelled.\n\nEach consecutive hit in a row with an axe increases Crit Chance by +^green;3^reset;% (to a maximum of ^green;15^reset;%)\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Dagger^reset;\n---------------\nConsecutive rapid kills temporarily increase damage\n\n+^green;25^reset;% Dodge Tech Efficiency\n\nCombo Strikes increase Protection and Crit Chance with each strike. The protection bonus is greatest on First Strike, and reduces each hit thereafter.\n\n^cyan;Dual-Wield (Melee):^reset; +^green;5^reset;% Movement Speed\n\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Shortsword^reset;\n---------------\n+1 Combo strike (was 2, now 3)\n\nEach combo hit increases your Crit Damage amount\n\n+^green;1^reset;% Crit Chance per Combo Strike\n\nFirst Combo strike does +^green;15^reset;% Crit Damage. Second hit does +^green;25^reset;% Crit Damage.\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Broadsword^reset;\n---------------\nKills made in rapid succession increase defense for a short time\n\n+^green;1^reset;% Crit Chance per Combo Strike\n\nFirst Combo strike does +^green;15^reset;% Crit Damage. Second hit does +^green;25^reset;% Crit Damage.\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Scythe^reset;\n---------------\n+^green;1^reset;% Crit Chance per Combo Strike\n\nFirst Combo strike does +^green;15^reset;% Crit Damage. Second hit does +^green;25^reset;% Crit Damage.\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Longsword^reset;\n---------------\n3rd Combo Strike does +^green;15^reset;% Crit Damage\n\n^cyan;Single Longsword^reset;: -^green;30^reset;% Combo Cooldown\n\n^cyan;Longsword + Shield (Dual Wield)^reset;: +^green;4^reset;% Shield Bash, +^green;1^reset; Shield Bash Push Distance, +^green;15^reset;% Healing Tech Efficiency, +^green;25^reset;% Defense Tech Efficiency\n\n^cyan;Longsword + Any Weapon (Dual Wield)^reset;: Defense x^red;0.8^reset;, +^green;5^reset;% Movement Speed\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Rapier^reset;\n---------------\nWhen wielding a rapier, the longer you wait between swings the higher your critical strike chance becomes (to a maximum of 5). Attacking resets this bonus.\n\n^cyan;Single Rapier:^reset; +^green;15^reset;% Crit Damage, +^green;35^reset;% Dodge and Dash Tech Efficiency\n\n^cyan;Rapier + Dagger (Dual Wield):^reset; x^green;1.12^reset; Protection, +^green;15^reset;% Dodge and Dash Tech Efficiency\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Shortspear^reset;\n---------------\n^cyan;Single Shortspear^reset;: +^green;30^reset;% Crit Damage\n\n^cyan;Shortspear + Shield^reset;: +^green;10^reset;% Shield Bash, +^green;2^reset; Shield Push Distance, Shield Regen x^green;1.2^reset;, +^green;50^reset;% Defense Tech Efficiency\n\n^cyan;Shortspear + Shortspear (Dual Wield)^reset;: Defense x^red;0.8^reset;, Bonus Crit Chance x^red;0.5^reset;\n\nShort Spears also count as Hunting weapons.\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Spear^reset;\n---------------\nSpears are relatively straightforward. They gain crit chance, higher damage output and an increase in Dash Tech efficiency.\n\nSpears can be held out by holding the fire button to help keep enemies at bay. If using a Lance typed spear you also gain increased damage based on your movement speed while holding it out. It cannot be aimed during this.\n\nSpears also count as Hunting weapons.\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Quarterstaff^reset;\n---------------\nEach hit with a combo increases your Defense.\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Mace^reset;\n---------------\nCombo strikes increase Stun Chance by 2% per hit.\n\n^cyan;Single Mace^reset;: +^green;2^reset;% Stun Chance\n\n^cyan;Mace + Shield^reset;: +^green;3^reset;% Shield Bash, +^green;1^reset; Shield Push Distance, Defense x^green;1.1^reset;\n\n^cyan;Mace + Any Weapon (Dual Wield)^reset;: Bonus Crit Chance x^red;0.85^reset;, Bonus Stun Chance x^red;0.5^reset;, +^green;5^reset;% Movement Speed\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Katana^reset;\n---------------\nEach swing grants a Movement Speed bonus of ^green;1 + (combo step / 10)^reset;%\n\nCombo hits increase knockback resistance\n\n^cyan;Single Katana^reset;: +^green;15^reset;% Defense Tech Efficiency\n\n^cyan;Katana + Heavy Melee (Dual Wield)^reset;: Damage x^red;0.8^reset;, Defense x^red;0.9^reset;\n\n^cyan;Katana + Light Melee (Dual Wield)^reset;: Energy x^green;1.15^reset;, +^green;20^reset;% Crit Damage, +^green;25^reset;% Dodge and Dash Tech Efficiency\n\n^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;\n^orange;Fists^reset;\n---------------\n\nNormal attacks consume ^red;3% energy^reset; per attack.
