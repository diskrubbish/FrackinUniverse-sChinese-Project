    "raw": "The origin of the Agaran species has long been disputed. There are many factors at play in the ongoing argument, but the largest contributor to their mystery is how they disperse themselves through the cosmos. While the rest of us require ships and technology, Agarans are able to simply ^green;emit a spore cloud^reset; and eventually some will find their way through the atmosphere due to their unusually resilient structure.\n\nEven more unusual is how difficult these spores are to even examine! The structure of these spores is ever-shifting which makes any detailed analysis slow-going. We've been able to come to several conclusions based on the evidence presented thus far however:\n\n- All Agarans are quite fatally affected by any atmosphere lacking nitrogen. Any such place results in their eventual suffocation, and that's if they are able to survive the blistering that accompanies it (both interally and externally).\n- An Agaran is not merely hard to understand - their ability to create sounds relies on swift vibrations that creates a hum-like sound. Our translators are not able to mimic these tonal emissions. This makes the species quite unintelligible.\n- They are linked directly to Florans at the genetic level, despite having a completely re-arranged set of internal organs (and some new organs the purpose of which we can only guess). It is believed that spores affected Florans, and genetically mutated their hosts bodies.\n- The spores emitted from an Agaran are able to track sources of warm moisture (especially blood) from several kilometers away and use wind to reach their target. While not sapient, it is most certainly some sort of behavior previously not displayed by this sort of organism.\n\nThe spores emitted by these creatures can prove ^red;exceptionally^reset; fatal, and any individual killed by these spores will become a host to a parasite within. This parasite will immediately 'hijack' the hosts central nervous system. At this point the Agaran conciousness is born. I advise any explorers that notice a clan of this species to stay clear for this reason. There are tales of entire colonies being decimated in a matter of days by spore clouds.\n\n\n    ",
    "value": "关于蘑菇人种族的起源一直都存在争议，在这场持续不断的争论中有许多因素起着作用，但对争论最大贡献是：他们如何通过宇宙传播自己的？当其他像我们这样的种族发展飞船和科技的时候，蘑菇人只需的^green;发射孢子云^reset;，最终一些孢子会由于其异常坚韧的结构找到途径穿过大气层。\n\n而更不寻常的是这些孢子极难检测！这些孢子的结构会不断变化，使得对其的任何详细分析都进展缓慢。不过，根据迄今为止呈现的证据，我们已经能够得出几个结论：\n\n- 缺乏氮气的大气环境对蘑菇人来说是极度致命的，任意这样的环境最终都会导致他们窒息，而且还要忍受伴随其间（内外部）产生的灼热感。\n- 理解蘑菇人语言可不仅仅是难 - 因为他们的发声能力依赖于快速振动，从而产生类似嗡嗡声的声音。我们的翻译人员无法模仿这些音调，这使得该物种相当难以理解。\n- 尽管他们具有完全重新排列的内部器官（以及一些功能我们只能依靠猜测的新器官），但他们在基因层面上与叶族是同源的。据信孢子能影响了叶族人，并导致寄主体遗传变异。\n- 从蘑菇人身上发射的孢子能够追踪数公里之内温暖水分（尤其是血液）的来源，并利用风来到达目标位置。尽管没有智能，但这肯定是这种生物之前没有表现过的某种行为。\n\n这些生物散发出的孢子可以被证明是^red;极其^reset;致命的，任何被这些孢子杀死的个体都将成为寄生物的宿主。这种寄生物会迅速“劫持”宿主的中枢神经系统，从那一刻起，蘑菇人的意识就诞生了。我建议任何注意到此物种族群的探险者都应该远离，因为有传言说一整个殖民地在几天之内就被孢子云摧毁殆尽了。\n\n\n"
