No text ever speaks of their species identification. Nothing ever mentions a homeworld, star, system...if they were xenophobes they were exceptionally protective and paranoid ones.",

A massive, well-preserved and fully functioning library. The information within is, without a doubt, the most significant archaeological find in the history of the entire cosmos. All I need to do is make it to the meeting on Earth and I can present my findings after the Protectorate emergency summit.",
