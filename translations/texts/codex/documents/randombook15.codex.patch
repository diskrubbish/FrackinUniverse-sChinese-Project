    "raw": "An alarming discovery was recently made while spying in a Floran collective. A row of Floran warriors were lined up, which was normal enough; what wasn't was the weaponry they bared.For one, it was the array of weaponry; several tech levels higher than would be assumed for them.",
    "value": "最近，在叶族人的一个集体里进行谍报活动时，我有了一个惊人的发现。叶族人排成一排，这很正常，然而他们所携带的武器可不是。第一点，这是系列的武器装备; 武器中的一些技术水平比假设中的要高。"

    "raw": "Retreating to my scout ship wasn't going to be a quiet thing for sure, the sound of their weapon tests ringing out, rocking the air, and shaking my very being. Leaving their jungle huts safely out of my sight, it was only upon reaching the clearing where I had parked my shuttle that it now became clear that my choice of parking spot was a dire mistake. My personal shuttle, dented and firmly smashed up by runaway cannonballs,\nseveral of her systems damaged, the orbital engines nearly critically so. As I flee this planet of the damned, projectile warnings ring out from my Bitching Betty unit. But my shuttle is too damaged for anything but the laziest of evasions, I pray aloud that my ship won't be struck; the ablative plating already having been crumpled into a very expensive ball.",
    "value": "撤退到我的侦察船肯定不会是一件安静的事情，他们武器测试的声音响了出来，震动了空气，震动了我的身体。把他们的丛林小屋安全地留在我的视线之外，直到我到达停放我航空船的空地时，我才清楚地意识到，我选择的停泊位是一个可怕的错误。我的私人航天飞机被失控的炮弹狠狠地撞毁，\n她的几个系统损坏，轨道引擎几乎严重损坏。当我逃离这个被诅咒的星球的时候，我的恶毒贝蒂单元发出了抛射警告的声音。但是我的航天飞机损坏得太严重了，除了最低限度的逃避，我大声祈祷我的飞船不会被击中; 烧蚀的镀层已经被揉成一个非常昂贵的球。"
