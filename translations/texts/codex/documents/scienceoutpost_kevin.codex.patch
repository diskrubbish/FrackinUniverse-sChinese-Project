Peeing on a beehive. He then filled the room with bees, so that when I opened the door I got swarmed and stung 755 times.\n\n^#EDB347;Jun 2^#FFFFFF; - Against all better judgement I allowed Kevin to borrow my bunsen burner. When asked to return it, he brought back a small stack of ash and announced that you can burn a bunsen burner with another bunsen burner if you allow it to burn long enough.\n\n^#EDB347;Jun 3^#FFFFFF; - My lab notes went missing. Weeks of work. When asking around, several others saw Kevin take them from my desk. I found them later, folded up and being used to prop up a wobbly table.\n\n^#EDB347;Jun 12^#FFFFFF; - Kevin got back from vacation today. Is it a coincidence that my lunch was swapped with a bucket of mooshi urine on the same day?\n\n^#EDB347;Jun 13^#FFFFFF; - Kevin is forbidden from using the coffee machine, it took me 2 hours to clean the mess it made. I don't care where he got all that blood, it's just unsanitary and I won't stand for it.\n\n^#EDB347;Jun 14^#FFFFFF; - A reminder that the Coffee Machine in the kitchen is to be used EXCLUSIVELY for brewing coffee. Any other substance should not be used under any circumstances, so please do not put any of these in the machine: Fruit (of any kind), Vegetables (of any kind), Meat, Florans,  Pixels, Aether, Mercury, Blood.\n\n^#EDB347;Jun 15^#FFFFFF; - All of the toilet paper rolls appear to have been replaced with sandpaper. All of them. Even the backups. I can hear Kevin giggling.\n\n^#EDB347;Jun 19^#FFFFFF; - Why the hell is all of the hydrochloric acid gone and replaced with vodka?!?!\n\n^#EDB347;Jun 22^#FFFFFF; - That son of a bitch swapped the natural gas and hydrogen tanks. I don't think he realizes how dangerous that could have been.\n\n^#EDB347;Jun 25^#FFFFFF; - Despite his clear genius, when asked on where he completed his education Kevin merely slapped me on the ass and told me to be a good servant and get him a coffee.

We've invited some bee-science folk to come and fill the space. It made sense, on account of the *thousands of bees* he put in my office in June still roaming around.\n\n^#EDB347;Oct 15^#FFFFFF; - I attempted to prank Kevin. I apparently suck. Not only did it fail, he found it, dismantled it and placed it in my room. I am now the proud owner of a giant bucket of Poptop feces spilled on my floor.\n\n^#EDB347;Oct 20^#FFFFFF; - I cannot believe that just happened. Kevin weaponized a shark by using a capture ball on a timer attached to a complicated mechanism. I was eating lunch, and a *great white shark* appears directly above my table, eats my lunch, and then enters a portal on the table and dissapears. I really hate Kevin.\n\n^#EDB347;Oct 25^#FFFFFF; - Bandits attacked. Kevin used weaponized shark to kill them.

We can't hurt them, because they just burrow into pocket dimensions or something...and then pop back out and annoy. This is not going to be fun.\n\n^#EDB347;Oct 27^#FFFFFF; - The Bunny-thing in my office is especially annoying. I think Kevin has genetically modified them, as mine cannot stop swearing. It literally does nothing but call me a litany of racist remarks, gives me the finger, and pops back into its...hole thing.\n\n^#EDB347;Oct 29^#FFFFFF; - Three days is enough. I left my office, and had the life support system withdraw all air from the unit. It took six minutes and fifty-three seconds but the bunny-thing died in panic.

    "raw": "^#EDB347;Nov 16^#FFFFFF; - Today we had a new visitor, and by \"new\" I mean \"we have never seen this species up until today\". He says his species is \"Spirit Guardian\", or just \"Spirit\" for short. He was quite popular with the bio-science team, given that his species has biological males and females, yet they do not have the organs necessary for procreation. He explained that they are instead created by a giant tree called the \"Spirit Tree\".\n\nThis information was very interesting to our team members, so they asked him to return to the outpost tomorrow for some testing. I bring this up in the infraction log because I couldn't help but to notice Kevin frequently walking in front of the doorway to our meeting room during our initial encounter with the Spirit. It was kind of giving me a bad vibe. I'll have to ask him what's on his mind.\n\n^#EDB347;Nov 17^#FFFFFF; - Turns out that Kevin was simply interested in participating in the tests we had planned for today. We had planned to take a genetic sample, take measurements of his body proportions and mass, and get other various physiological attributes. The usual stuff.\n\nEverything went smoothly, and dare I say that Kevin was actually *pretty helpful* in getting this thing done. Not only that, but our visitor became quite comfortable with him. I was thinking on actually thanking him for his good work, but before I could, Kevin left the lab because he had to \"go to the bathroom\". Not that big a deal, we were in the conclusion process anyway, so we were able to finish the work without him. Turns out, Kevin was just waiting behind the doorway with an airhorn. When the Spirit left the room, Kevin blew the horn. The Spirit got scared so badly that when he kicked off of the wall to propel himself away, he ended up putting a good size dent into the sheet metal. I think the sound of him kicking the wall startled people more than the airhorn did, now that I consider it.",
    "value": "^#EDB347;十一月十六日^#FFFFFF; - 今天我们有了一个新的访客，我所说的“新”是指“我们直到今天才见到这种物种”。他说他的物种是“精灵卫士” ，或者简称为“精灵”。他在生物科学团队中相当受欢迎，因为他的物种有生物学上的雄性和雌性，但是他们没有生殖所必需的器官。他解释说，他们是由一棵被称为“灵树”的大树创造出来的。 我们的队员对这个信息很感兴趣，所以他们让他明天回前哨基地做测试。我在违规日志中提到这一点，因为在我们与精灵初次相遇的时候，我不禁注意到凯文经常走在我们会议室的门口。 这让我有种不祥的预感。 我得问问他在想什么。\n\n^#EDB347;十一月十七日^#FFFFFF; - 说到底原来凯文只是对参加我们今天计划的测试感兴趣。我们计划取一个基因样本，测量他的头身和质量，并得到其他各种各样的生理特征。很普通的流程。\n\n一切都进行得很顺利，我敢说凯文实际上在这件事上“帮了大忙”。不仅如此，我们的客人也和他相处得很融洽。我真的想感谢他的出色工作，但是在我感谢他之前，凯文离开了实验室，因为他要“去洗手间”。 没什么大不了的，反正我们正处于结论阶段，所以我们能够在没有他的情况下完成工作。又说到底，凯文只是拿着号角在门口等着。当精灵离开房间时，凯文吹响了号角。精灵被吓坏了，他踢开墙壁，赶着自己离开，最终在金属板上留下了一个相当大的凹痕。现在想起来，我觉得他踢墙的声音比号角声更让人震惊。"
