    "raw": "The most harrowing time for the X'ian people came soon after. According to texts there are accounts that speak of invaders or visitors from 'elsewhere' that interrupted their progress through literal planetary upheaval and forced terraforming. While none of the records name this race speculation is high that it could have been the Anodyne due in part to their description being a close match. This is now, sadly, rumor pulled from antiquated records...at best.",
    "value": "对艾肯人来说，最痛苦的时刻很快就降临了。根据文献记载，有些说法提到入侵者或来自“其他地方”的访客，由于行星剧变和被迫地球化化而中断了他们的发展。虽然没有一个记录的名字，但这个种族的猜测应该很准确，很可能是燃星人，部分原因在于他们对这段历史的描述是一场紧张的竞赛。不幸的是，这是从过时的记录中得到的谣言... 充其量也就是谣言。"
