    "raw": "I am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without knowing why. It is altogether against my will that I tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the antarctic with its vast fossil-hunt and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient ice-cap—and I am the more reluctant because my warning may be in vain. Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet if I suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would be nothing left.",
    "value": "我被迫开口说话，因为科学家们不知道为什么就是拒绝听从我的建议。我完全不情愿地讲述了我反对这种计划中对南极入侵的理由，因为这种入侵涉及大规模的化石搜寻，以及对古代冰盖的大规模钻孔和融化——其实我更不情愿，因为我的警告可能是徒劳的。对确切事实的怀疑，正如我必须揭示它们，是不可避免的; 然而，如果我掩盖那些看起来过分和不可思议的东西，就会一无所有。"

It is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and",
