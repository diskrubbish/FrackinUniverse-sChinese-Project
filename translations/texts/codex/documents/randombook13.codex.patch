    "raw": "There exists a species so strange in its mating habits...so unorthodox...that literally the entire galaxy is curious about it. These creatures will mate nearly anywhere and for effectively no reason at all besides fun or a means to pass the time (in some documented cases). And yet...their gestation? Slow. Their young? Mewling and helpless for quite some time. The species? Human.",
