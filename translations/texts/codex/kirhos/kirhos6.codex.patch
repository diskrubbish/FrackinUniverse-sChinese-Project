    "raw": "Although the Kirhos have their share of sculptors, engineers, and mercenaries, they are perhaps best known as traders. Kirhosi vessels are welcome in many places, for they bring delightfully disruptive theories of government, fossilized fragments of time, and densinium-forged surgical tools; they bring wild-eyed weapons that speak. If you can describe it, so they say, there is a Kirhos who is willing to sell it to you.",
    "value": "虽然鼠人有雕刻家、工程师和雇佣兵，但他们最出名的可能是商人。鼠人制造在许多地方都很受欢迎，因为其带来了令人愉快的政府分裂理论、时间的化石碎片，以及仿造牙齿的外科手术工具; 它们带来了会说话的狂野的武器。如果你能描述一样东西，他们会说，有一个鼠族人愿意卖给你。"

    "raw": "In the ordinary course of things, the Kirhos accept barter for payment. They claim that it is a language that even the universe understands. They've spent a great deal of time to attempting to justify the profit motive in view of conservation laws. Most of them converge comfortably on the position that profit is the civilized response to entropy. The traders themselves vary, as you might expect, in the rapacity of their bargains. But then, as they often say, value is contextual.",
    "value": "在一般情况下，鼠族人接受以物易物。他们声称这是一种连宇宙都能理解的语言。他们已经花费了大量的时间试图证明利润动机在保护法律的观点。他们中的大多数人都认为利润是对熵的文明反应。正如你所料，交易员们自己也会因为讨价还价的贪婪而有所不同。但是，正如他们经常说的，价值是上下文相关的。"

Thus every trader is also an engineer. The drives’ designers made some attempt to make the drives modular, but this was a haphazard enterprise at best.",
    "value": "当鼠族人决定有必要以这种货币支付或获得支付时，他们将花费数月——有时甚至数年 - 根据需要对其船只进行改装。 因此，每个交易者都是工程师。驱动器的设计者做了一些尝试，使驱动器模块化，但这充其量只是一次偶然的行动。"

    "raw": "One Kirhosi trader wrote of commerce between universes, which would require the greatest stardrive of all. The Kirhos do not see any reason they can't bargain with the universe itself, and are slowly accumulating their wealth toward the time when they can trade their smaller coins for one that will take them to this new goal. They rarely speak of this with outsiders, but most of them are confident that no one else will be able to outbid them.",
    "value": "一位鼠族商人写到了宇宙间的商业，这需要最强大的星际驱动力。 鼠族人认为他们没有任何理由不能与宇宙本身讨价还价，他们正在慢慢积累他们的财富，直到他们可以用较小的硬币交换一枚可以带他们实现这个新目标的硬币。他们很少向外界透露这一点，但他们中的大多数人都相信，没有人能够出价比他们更高。"
