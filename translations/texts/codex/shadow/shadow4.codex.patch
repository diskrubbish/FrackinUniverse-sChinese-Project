    "raw": "Many are certain that the Novakid are fragments of the Cultivator, that ancient being responsible for seeding the cosmos with what we know and giving birth to all things. If this is the case, how do we explain the presence of the Tenebrhae? All tests seem to point to them being truly ancient in origin, and their very natures link them to the stuff of the cosmos as well.",

I theorize that there are perhaps more things that predate all known life beyond just the Cultivator. Perhaps even a mate! Could such a thing be possible? Is there, somewhere among the stars, a female counterpart to the Cultivator?",

Most think their Hive-like mental link is nothing more than a psionic connection that goes beyond all we know...but what if they are wrong and they are in fact communing with (or are pieces of) some massive and ancient power? Some sort of being that gave rise to all of the Darkness, while the Cultivator gave rise to Light?",
