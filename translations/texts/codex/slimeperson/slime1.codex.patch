Host is human, no doubt there...there is too little body hair for this to be Apex, not to mention a complete lack of pronounced brow ridge. Based on medical data of the human species I have determined that the subject was dead for at least 24 hours prior to melding with the foreign body.",
    "value": "在仔细检查了9号样本之后，我已经能够根据宿主的生理确定共生体本身的一些最不寻常的细节。宿主是人类，这毫无疑问……他们的体毛太少了，更不用说那不明显的眉脊了，因此不可能是猿族。根据人类的医学数据，我确定受试者在与异物融合之前至少死亡了24小时。"

    "raw": "Cause of death is apparently a prion of unknown origin that is keyed specifically to the human genome. It appears to be unhinged from standard quantum space, able to straddle the interdimensional realm we call sub-space and utilize this as a means of transmission. This would, interestingly enough, allow the prion to infect anyone it wanted within a range of approximately 2 light years. More research on this prion will be conducted later.",
    "value": "死亡原因是一种起源不明的朊病毒，它与人类基因组特异性相关。它似乎脱离了标准的量子空间，能够跨越被我们称之为亚空间的跨维度领域，并将其作为传输手段。有趣的是，这将允许朊病毒在大约2光年的范围内感染它想要的任何人。更多关于朊病毒的研究将在之后说明。"

    "raw": "After initial incubation period, the priod takes over control of the cerebral cortex. There it stimulates neurons in such a way as to somehow, through unknown means of energy transmission, stimulate the spontaneous growth of an egg. From this egg, a microbial parasite hatches within 12 to 72 hours. This parasite feasts on the hosts brain tissue, using them to construct some sort of neural link with the host at the cellular level.",

This would mean that literally all populations with remaining tech associated with this prion could be an immediate threat to the Republic.

It immediately begins consuming the hosts brain from the inside out, absorbing memory and motor function, and quite possibly everything else that made the host a unique individual. Soon after consumption is complete, the host body dies. The parasite severs its link immediately and consumes itself. The waste material created then does something truly strange.",

This Symbiote feeds on the tissue of the host's body after first encasing it in a sleek and gloppy coat of slime. This process can take as long as 7 weeks. Once the body is consumed, the Symbiote awakens with a translucent slimey body that mimics that of the original host. They are a fresh slate, newly born and unique.",
