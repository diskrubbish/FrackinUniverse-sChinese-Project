    "raw": "The Nightar are actually pre-disposed to extreme xenophobia at the genetic level. They fear the unknown in ways we don't fully understand. Imagine what it is like to hate and fear sunlight! It is in our ignorance of that life that the Nightar gain their power in the political spectrum. Their dislike of the light keeps them well away from affairs of state for other species, always quiet in the background. At home in the dark, they excel at stealth in ways the rest of us simply cannot match. This has led to them knowing many secrets of the various players in galactic politics >",
    "value": "事实上，“夜之星”在基因水平上倾向于极端的排外情绪。他们以我们不完全理解的方式对未知事物感到恐惧。想象一下憎恨和恐惧太阳是什么滋味！正是在我们对这种生活的无知中，夜之星在政治光谱中获得了力量。他们对光明的厌恶使他们远离其他物种的国家大事。相反，他们扮演了一个更加间谍化的角色。在家里的黑暗中，他们擅长的秘密行动方式是我们其他人根本无法比拟的。这使得他们知道了银河政治中各种玩家的许多秘密..。"

If you cross a Nightar who has taken a keen liking to less 'savory' sorts of work...hire them, before your enemies do. A word of advice: Trade with these people using metal coinage rather than electronic funds, and pay up front. Their people adore metal due to complex socioeconomic reasons on their homeworld.",
