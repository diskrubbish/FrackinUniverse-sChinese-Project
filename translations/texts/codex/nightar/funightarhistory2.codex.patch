It will benefit us all to better understand this enigmatic people and their way of life away from sunlight the rest of us take for granted.",

The reason is simple:  The Fulgrat is their military General only. The true political pull among the Nightar comes from the females.",

Males who do so must be cleansed through ritual combat followed by Conshak, a 'transfer of energy' from Beyond and into the warrior.",

This seems to be sufficient explanation to them.",
