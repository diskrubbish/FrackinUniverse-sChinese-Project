    "raw": "After only 20 generations we have observed them not only develop sapience on their own, but also develop more and more complex tools. The downside is that the length of time chosen for the experiment is much too long, and our empires expansion in this dimension has effectively limited our funding. We are unable to wait...so we have opted to speed things up a tad.",

    "raw": "Rather than allow a further 20 generations (510 additional rotations around the sun) to pass uninfluenced, we have gone ahead and shown our little slave-race the secrets of the universe. We left behind a drone and three combat units, completely deactivated. We have estimated a 500% increase in technological advancement within 20 years time. These once docile fuzzy raptors will soon be truly entertaining.",
    "value": "我们没有让20代人(围绕太阳旋转510圈)不受影响地通过，而是向我们这个奴隶种族展示了宇宙的秘密。我们留下了一架无人机和三个战斗单位，完全失效。我们估计在20年内，他们的技术进步会增加500% 。这些曾经温顺的毛茸茸的猛禽很快就会变得非常有趣。"
