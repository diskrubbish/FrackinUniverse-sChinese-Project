The cities of this planet were just as opulent as I had heard, buildings crafted from crystal and gold, towering spires that touched the sky. Their temples were a sight to behold. I did not venture inside out of respect for the worshippers",

The temples that I had seen were here also, but as piles of dirty rubble, and banners embroidered with a symbol I had not seen before were laid torn and ruined on the ground.",
