    "raw": "The head of the council is chosen once every ten years through this method, a male one decade, and a female the next. It is considered their divine right to rule, and their word sways the entire races' social/economic development for the next ten years. In more recent times, this has been abused, and the current head of the temple council - Ka'tir Upitah - intends to keep her rule until she eventually dies, claiming to be a direct messenger from the deity Ahvis. ",
    "value": "议会主席每十年通过这种方法选举一次，一个十年男性，一个十年女性。人们认为他们拥有神圣的统治权，他们的言论影响着未来十年整个种族的社会和经济发展。在更近的时代，这种做法遭到滥用，圣殿理事会的现任主席——卡蒂尔乌皮塔——打算维持她的统治，直到她最终去世，她声称自己是来自神灵的直属信使。"
