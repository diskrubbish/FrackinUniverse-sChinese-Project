Considering the carbon-dating and the undocumented language I imagine that Princeton is going to have an absolute field day sharing our discovery with the world. That is, of course, provided we ever manage to get back to camp. Something strange happened that neither Richter nor myself can even begin to adequately explain.",

I don't know what happened to Richter, but he wasn't with me when I came to. Around me now is some sort of temple matching the door we found, and I can hear something. I don't know what it is, but it is close. I have only enough power to last another few hours and then my reserve batteries will be wiped",

I will endeavor to investigate this place further...I have little else to do and my meager supply of food means I don't have the luxury of time...",
