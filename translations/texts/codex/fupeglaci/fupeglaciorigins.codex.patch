To us, song is memory. We record our history into our minds and our souls through voice, and these vibrations pass from Mother to Whelp with each spawning season.",

Our lives were nomadic, where we gathered in hunting bands, raiding other groups and running off with their young. We were savage, relentless and without mercy. That may be what attracted the Wanderers to our world in the first place.",

Over the course of several centuries they guided our species from savagery to civilization, and we were more than willing to do whatever they asked as thanks for their gifts. They were more than happy to abuse our dependence on them, using us as they saw fit to achieve their ends. The price was small for the gains we obtained.",
