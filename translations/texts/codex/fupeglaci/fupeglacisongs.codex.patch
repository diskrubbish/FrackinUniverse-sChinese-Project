Their people have honed their vocal cords over millenia into some of the most advanced sound-making organs known to science. They are capable of reaching a stunning 15 to 40 octave range, depending on their familial heritage!",
    "value": "在星际间核心的种族中，很少有人能像企鹅那样唱出动听的歌曲。 他们的人已经把他们的声带磨练了几千年，进化成了一些科学上已知的最先进的发声器官。他们能够达到惊人的15到40个八度音程范围，这取决于他们的种族传统！"

She also uses this voice to keep her clients calm and well-behaved. A boon to her women-in-waiting.",
