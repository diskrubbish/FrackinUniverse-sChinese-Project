They work alongside creepy thinky fish like we work alongside Kirhos, though we think is unease between Lutrin and Hylotl because of body language. Also interesting is that Lutrin speak similar to us. Did Fenerox get Lutrin language, or did Kirhos give Lutrin language, too?",

    "raw": "Maybe Lutrin can hunt alongside Floran and Fenerox, too, see who is best hunter. Can tell that otter is hunter because they take down angry flying bird with big spear they is carrying. Kirhos later tell us Lutrin was hunter of Hylotl, but is now hunter for Hylotl, same as Fenerox is hunter for Kirhos. So Lutrin therefore think of Hylotl like Fenerox think of Avian. Still curious about who got language from who. Will ask later.",
