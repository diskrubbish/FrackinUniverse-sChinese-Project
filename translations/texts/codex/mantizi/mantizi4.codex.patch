Few are those among the elite who are not familiar with the narcotic qualities of these wines. Highly sought, their value on the black market is insultingly astronomical.",

    "raw": "For the Mantizi themselves, however, the wine is simply delicious. Their natural immunity to the toxin common in the grapes they use gives them no ill effects. Meanwhile, Avians are well-known to be especially susceptible. Most Mantizi hoard a few bottles at any given time (if they have access to stores of them in their family holdings) but are loathe to part with them. In some of the more lawless sectors, Mantizi are captured and 'inspired' by pirates into 'donating' their supply.",
