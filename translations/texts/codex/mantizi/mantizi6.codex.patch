    "raw": "We must never forget how close we came to annihiliation. The Thelusians were a formidable adversary for nearly 200 years, and managed to fight us to a standstill despite our best efforts. They accomplished this not with numbers, nor with their tough chitin. No, it was their skill. Until we were able to create the Yashvarra Nyi (Light Spear) using the strange lore of the ancients as a guide...we were nothing. Once the Doctrine was in practice, and the Yashvarra perfected they were beaten back with ease.",
