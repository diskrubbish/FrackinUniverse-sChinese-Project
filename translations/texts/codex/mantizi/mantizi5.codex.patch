Each thrust with the Light Spear should be done through the opening, never dropping the guard. Should the wall falter, the entire formation will fail. This will spell the end of your unit. Drill your forces until they hate you for it, and then drill some more.",

Our ancestors developed the plasmic-formed zerchesium spears to be perfect all-purpose weapons, and we shame them by forgetting what was sacrificed in their invention. The Ten-Generation War proved that our might was virtually unassailable to the enemy. The doctrine works. Adhere to it, or perish to the Great Enemy.",
