  "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer\n\nAs one of my frequent attempts at cultural sensitivity, I decided to try and further integrate myself with my hosts. While exploring the castle, I found a number of decorative suits of armour that appear to depict great Glitch warriors. Naturally, to make my companions comfortable, I put a suit on.": "作者：鲛人冒险家平木·圣咏\n\n作为我在文化敏感性上的频繁尝试之一，我决定更深一步的入乡随俗。在探索这座城堡时，我发现了一些装饰性的电子人战士盔甲。当然了，为了让同伴们放轻松，我就穿上了一件。\n\n穿上盔甲后很难走路，所以我好几次失去平衡。实际上，我在下楼的时候是一路滚到了大厅，引得所有电子人都在看我。迎接我的并非是想象中的热情问候，反而是他们开始哭泣和大叫。我听到了很多次“愤怒”和“厌恶”。然后他们就开始追我。",
  "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer\n\nI found myself at somewhat of an impasse; behind me, a horde of Glitch with pitchforks and torches were swarming my way. Ahead of me, the opening to a sewer. I made my call, and dived headlong into the dark tunnels.\n\nOh, what a narrow escape! Now I am down here, exploring the maze-like corridors, encountering not a soul. It is, in fact, rather peaceful.": "作者：鲛人冒险家平木·圣咏\n\n我发现自己进了一条死路；在我身后，一大群拿着草叉和火把的电子人蜂拥而来。在我前方，是一条开放的下水道。我下了决定，一头扎进了黑暗的隧道中。\n\n哦，真是九死一生！现在我进到这里，探索迷宫一样的走廊，却连个鬼影也没有。实际上，这里很安静。\n\n水滴从天花板上不断滴落，在脚下形成一条水流，巨大翅膀扇出的嗡嗡声不时在我身后传来…",
  "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer\n\nLet it never be said that I do not attempt to integrate with whichever hosts I find myself indebted to. I have noticed that when addressing me, the Glitch use prefix words. Examples: \"Dismissive\", \"Annoyed\", \"Alarmed\" and \"Frustrated\". Feeling as if this is a custom I should practice, I have begun to partake in such linguistic frippery myself.": "作者：鲛人冒险家平木·圣咏\n\n别说那些我不会尝试去效仿那些我感到和蔼的东家的话。我注意到在电子人提到我的时候，会使用前缀词汇。例如：“不屑”，“懊恼”，“惊慌”和“沮丧”。感觉到这可能是个应当练习的习俗，我开始在自己的话中加入这样的语言片段。\n\n“开心。很高兴见到你。”我说，但那个我与之打招呼的电子人只是给了我一个奇怪的表情，然后和他的朋友说了些什么。也许这是我由于考虑失误而违反了某种习俗？",
  "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer\n\nSo I'm trapped in a tomb. Been here for a couple of weeks, by my count. I can't find the way out. I triggered a secret door and, because secret doors are super exciting, went inside. It closed behind me, and now I'm stuck in some dusty set of tunnels. I'll find my way out eventually, of course, I always do. I'm surprised nobody's rescued me though; I've certainly been making a lot of noise.": "作者：鲛人冒险家平木·圣咏\n\n看来我被困在墓中了。算起来，我在这已经待了好几周了。可我还是没能找到出路。我触发了一个隐藏门，因为隐藏门让人感到兴奋，于是我就进去了。它在我身后关上，所以现在我被困在满是灰尘的隧道里了。当然，我最终会发现出路的，我一直都能。不过让我感到惊讶的是，竟然没人来救我，我明明弄出了很大的声响。",
  "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer\n\nThe hospitality of the Glitch is indisputable. When we met, they found me scaling the castle wall, attempting to have a look through a tower window; they politely invited me inside. Now, of course it sounded like a trap, so there was a bit of a scuffle at first, but it turned out they were genuine.": "作者：鲛人冒险家平木·圣咏\n\n电子人的好客是无可争议的。当我们见面时，他们发现我在攀爬城墙，只是为了透过塔上的一扇窗往里看看时，有礼貌的把我邀请了进去。当然了，这话现在听起来像是一个陷阱，所以刚开始有点混乱，但事实证明他们是真心的。\n\n他们让我在城堡里通行无阻，好让我探索，研究和论证我的想法。我偶尔能碰上他们的一员，他们会很友好的打招呼。我一直在读各种各样令人陶醉的书籍，我对电子人的了解也越来越丰富了。",
  "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer\n\nTrees! They live in trees. These wild, savage plant-people live in huge tree houses built with care and attention. Well, not all of them do. I mean, they also live in caves, and the occasional crevice. It's a far cry from our wonderful ocean paradises, of course, but one has to admire the tenacity with which this species attempts to carve out a niche to call their own.": "作者：鲛人冒险家平木·圣咏\n\n树！他们生活在树上。这些野生，野蛮的植物人住在精心建造的巨大的树屋里。呃，也不是都这样。我的意思是，他们还住在洞穴和偶然出现的裂缝里。当然，这与我们美好的海洋天堂真是天壤之别，但还是应当欣赏这个物种试图为他们自己闯出一片新天地的那种韧性。\n\n这和你所期待的叶族工艺差不多—或者说还很少—但不可否认确实有一定的魅力。我已经在他们的某个树屋中躲了三天了，所以有足够的时间来学习这一点，并且等待机会悄悄的溜走。哦，真是次有趣的冒险！",
  "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer\n\nI've spent my days on this ship feeling exceptionally queasy, on occasion I have actually succumbed to the nausea and... Well, it is not polite to speak of it.\n\nRight now, I'm looking for a sidekick. And a plan! And a cause, maybe. I hear those Apex could use a little help. Or maybe the humans. I will crusade for justice throughout the galaxy, and it will be glorious.": "作者：鲛人冒险家平木·圣咏\n\n我在这艘船上待了好多天来感受这奇异的感觉，有时候我确实屈服于这恶心和…恩，这么说不太礼貌。\n\n现在，我正在寻找一个搭档和一个计划，以及一个目标。我听说那些猿人需要帮助。也许是人类。我将为整个星系的正义而战，这将无比荣耀。",
  "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer\n\nThe Miniknog certainly do treat the other Apex badly! So sad! Everyone is under constant surveillance and scrutiny, it's very tedious and stressful. Really, you can't blame me for ditching my escort, can you?\n\nI happened to find myself in what I think must be a Resistance Headquarters. So rebellious! I recognised some of the faces from wanted posters.": "作者：鲛人冒险家平木·圣咏\n\n科技发展部对待其他猿族的方式真是坏！坏透了！真伤心！每个人都在不断监视和审查，令人非常乏味而且压力巨大。说实话，你不能怪我甩掉我的护卫，不是吗？\n\n我碰巧发现自己在一个我认为肯定是反抗总部的地方。真是叛逆！我认出了一些出现在通缉令上的面孔。\n\n猿人们盯着我，就好象我是某种入侵者或者是其他什么。其中一个在不停的发抖，看起来很冷。所以我把自己的大猿牌夹克接给她了。真善良！",
  "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer\n\nTurns out the Apex resistance fellows are rather nice! They've given me a room of my own, and even locked the door in case the Miniknog storm in and endanger me. So thoughtful!\n\nEarlier, I pulled out my rocket launcher to show them the type of weaponry they should be considering, and it caused such a ruckus!": "作者：鲛人冒险家平木·圣咏\n\n原来猿人抵抗组织的成员都是好人！他们给了我一个属于我的房间，甚至把门锁起来防止科技发展部冲进来伤害我。太周到了！\n\n早些时候，我拿出我的火箭发射器给他们看，让他们考虑一下这种类型的武器，结果引起不小的骚动！\n\n我从没见过猿人这么激动。其中有个人迫不及待的想从我手上抢过去，于是在总部前面我们发生了一场涉及到火箭助推榴弹发射器的小意外。",
